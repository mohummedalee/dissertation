\chapter{Gender and Racial Biases in Job and Housing Ads}\label{chap:cscw}
The first paper in this dissertation investigates how advertising platforms can skew delivery of consequential opportunity ads, such as those for jobs and housing. We specifically investigate skews that arises along demographics of users, particularly self-described gender and race. Recall that we are interested in the algorithm's decisions and not the advertiser's, we specifically determine whether the ad delivery could cause skewed delivery that an advertiser did not cause by their targeting choices and may not even be aware of.

We focus on Facebook -- as it is the most mature platform offering advanced targeting features -- and run dozens of ad campaigns, hundreds of ads with millions of impressions, spending over \$8,500 as part of our study.
